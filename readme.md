Create a day of the week translator. (Use Switch Case)
Your program should read a variable called “dayNumber”, and print (with console.log) the corresponding day of the week, where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday.
For any other values, your program should print “Invalid day number”.
Test your program for all week days values.
